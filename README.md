# SoPra FS21 - BROLAT

## Project Idea

During the first couple of weeks this semester the members of our group recognized that it is often overwhelming to get a hold of all the deadlines from the different modules we booked. We think all this energy of planning the semester could be simplified.
For this reason, we want to build an app which shows your timetable and where you can set reminders for all the deadlines in a semester. The idea is that you can share these deadlines with all the other people in the respective module. Your peers can now accept the reminder and donâ€™t have to set it themselves. This way only one student needs to set reminders for all his peers. Additionally, we want peers to be able to chat and share their experiences with each other on the platform.
